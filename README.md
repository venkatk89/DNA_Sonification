# DNA_Sonification

This repo contains code to achieve DNA sonification. <br>

DNA Sonification refers to the use of an auditory display to convey the information content of DNA
sequence data <br>

Multiple approaches are taken to achieve sonification. Some algorithms focus on the how informative the process is and other algorithms focus on the musicality of the end product.
